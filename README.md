Gradient Descent
It is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost). 
It is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically (e.g. using linear algebra) and must be searched for by an optimization algorithm.
